## Question
How does ARIA avoid making things up?

## Answer
Verified-facts-only mode by default (ARIA_LLM_ENABLED=false). Answers come from canonical facts, FAQ, and verified Truth Ledger — no generative LLM on public chat. Factual skills are never rewritten by LLM. Social messages get a short template ack. If no verified source exists, ARIA says she lacks verified information. Operator can re-enable LLM later when grounding is trusted.

## Meta
- Canonical fact — edit `canonical_facts.yaml` when this truth changes
- Supersedes prior entry ids: `none`
- Sandbox path: `truth-ledger/2026-07-03/075426-canonical-anti-hallucination.md`
